# Eat Da Burger!
A Burger Eatin Application With Node.js Express MySQL Handlebars and Heroku.

## Description

This application is a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as *available* on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may eat any burger by clicking on the eat it! button, which moves it into the right column and updates its status in the database.
